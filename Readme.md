# Two Sum (Solution)

    # Given an array of intergers nums and an interger target
    # Return indexes of two numbers such that they add up to target
    # You may assue that each input would have exactly one Solution
    # You may not use the same element twice
    # You can return the answer in any order

# Example 1

    #   Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    #   Output: [0,1]
    #   Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

# Example 2

    #   Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
    #   Output: [1,2]

# Example 3

    #   Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
    #   Output: [0,1]

# Constraints

    # 2 <= nums.length <= 104
    # -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
    # -109 <= target <= 109
    # Only one valid answer exists.
